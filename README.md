# Design-and-Implementation-of-a-Pok-mon-Game-Using-Python-and-OOP
Object-oriented Pokémon battle game in Python featuring Fire, Water, and Electric types, trainer system, evolution mechanics with level-up and name changes, intelligent battle selection, and full trainer-vs-trainer combat simulation.
# Project Overview
This project implements a complete Pokémon-inspired battle system using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
The game simulates real Pokémon mechanics such as battles, trainers, evolution, catching logic, and type effectiveness through a clean and modular OOP architecture.

The project is based on an abstract Pokemon base class and demonstrates advanced use of inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and operator overloading.

# Main Features

* Three Pokémon types: Fire, Water, and Electric

* Abstract Pokemon base class

* Pokémon evolution with level-up and name changes

* Trainer system with:

  1.Catching mechanics

  2.Experience modifier

  3.Pokémon collection management

  4.Operator overloading (==, <, >, +)

* Battle system:

  1.One-on-one Pokémon duels

  2.Full Trainer vs Trainer battles

  3.Automatic selection of the most effective Pokémon

* Type-based damage calculation

* Safe data handling using deep copy
